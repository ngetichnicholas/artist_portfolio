      <p>
        Born and raised in The Bay Area in California. I’ve been doodling as far
        as I can remember and honed my skills in college as a Graphic Design
        Major. When I moved to New York for a few years I was inspired by the
        culture and the love of the city. </p> 
        <p>Back in 2016, I was in an artist block
        so I did a project on Instagram . I challenged myself to do 365
        portraits in 365 days. I wanted to level up my skills as a portrait
        artist and test a medium I had little to no experience with which was
        watercolors. This experience taught me few skills that I take with me
        today 
        <ul>
          <li>Watercolors is about patience and layers.</li>
          <li>The grid system is good
        to get proportions correct especially on portraits where likeness is
        key.</li>
          <li>Mistakes can lead to great results.</li>
          <li>In daily challenges, if you fail
        and let that hold you back you’re going to be playing catch up.</li>
          <li>Learn to
        control the water on the paper before and while applying colors.</li>
          <li>Don’t
        cheapen on supplies ( I learned that having the right brush, paper,
        pigments makes quite the difference in applying, timing, and control).</li>
          <li>Painting what motivates and inspires you makes for a better results.</li>
      </ul></p> 
        <p>Accomplishments: </p>
        <p><ul>
          <li>I was the featured artist at the 2019 San Francisco.</li>
          <li>Coffee Festival. I have collaborated with brands such as Philz Coffee
        and Chameleon Cold Brew. </li>
          <li>I was featured on ABC7 Localish.</li>
        </ul></p>
