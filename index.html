        <h2>Childhood</h2>  
        <p>Koffee Omolide was born January 19, 1954 in Glen Ridge, New Jersey (virtually a suburb of New York City). Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Huntington, Long Island, where Cindy grew up as the youngest of five children. Although her parents shared a general disinterest in the arts-her father was an engineer and her mother a reading teacher-Koffe chose to study art in college, enrolling at the State University of New York, at Buffalo, in the early 1990s.</p>    
        <h2>Early Training</h2>
        <p>Koffee studied in Buffalo from 1972-76; she began as a painter, but she quickly found herself frustrated by what she considered certain limitations of the medium. The 1970s was an eclectic era for painters working in the aftermath of <strong>Minimalism</strong>,this was the era when women were not allowed to paint or even have anything to do with books.Koffe would always watch her brother paint and every day they would paint a new picture .The brother once realising that Koffee was a good artist made a point of showcasing the paints and selling the painting but in his name since women were not allowed to paint.In 1980 Koffee decided that enough is enough and she went 
        solo in painting and selling .Her first painting was a hit ,it shoke the world for it was a elegant paint and that a woman was behind the awesome work.It was a surprise in return for she recived alot of support followed but other women painters releasing there work to the world.During her studies, Koffee met fellow artists Robert Longo and Charles Clough, with whom she co-founded Hallwalls Center for Contemporary Art in 1974 (it continues to function to the present day as a <strong>, multi-arts "hub")</strong>. Longo and Koffee dated until 1979. During her studies, teacher-Koffe was exposed to Conceptual art and other progressive art movements and media under the widely influential art instructor,
         Barbara Jo Revelle. Upon graduation, Koffee moved to New York City to pursue her artistic career. In 1977, with her downtown residential and studio loft as her primary backdrop, Koffee began taking a series of teaching classes  herself, a project she would eventually refer to as <em>the Untitled Film Stills</em>. In this series, Koffee embodies the character of "Everywoman." Re-fashioning herself repeatedly into the guise of various female archetypes, Koffee drew the <em>girly pin-up</em>, the <em>paint noir siren</em>, <em>the housewife,</em> <em>the prostitute</em>, and <em> noble damsel in distress</em>. The black-and-white paintings occupied her for about three years, so that by 1980 Koffee
          had virtually exhausted a myriad of seemingly timeless cliches referring to the "feminine."</p>
